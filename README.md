# AJAX API Call Example

This project demonstrates a simple AJAX call to fetch data from an API using JavaScript. It serves as a basic example for making asynchronous requests and handling the response.

## Features

- Sends an AJAX request to a public API.
- Handles the API response and displays the data.
- Uses modern JavaScript (ES6+) with `fetch`.

## How It Works

1. The JavaScript code sends an asynchronous request to the API using the `fetch` method.
2. The response is parsed as JSON.
3. The data is processed and displayed dynamically on the webpage.
